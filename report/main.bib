                  Background
                  Bleeding is the leading cause of preventable death after injury. This retrospective study aimed to characterize opportunities for performance improvement ({OPIs}) identified in patients who died from bleeding and were considered by the quality improvement system of a major trauma centre.
                  
                  
                  Methods
                  All trauma deaths in 2006–2010 were discussed at the trauma morbidity and mortality meeting. Deaths from haemorrhage were identified and subjected to qualitative and quantitative evaluation. {OPIs} were identified and remedial action was taken.
                  
                  
                  Results
                  During the study interval there were 7511 trauma team activations; 423 patients died. Haemorrhage was the second most common cause of death, in 112 patients, and made a substantial contribution to death in a further 15. For 84 of these 127 patients, a total of 150 {OPIs} were identified. Most arose in the emergency department, but involved personnel from many departments. Problems with decision-making were more common than errors in technical skill. {OPIs} frequently involved the decision between surgery, radiology and further investigation. Delayed and inappropriate surgery occurred even when investigation and diagnosis were appropriate. The mortality rate among patients presenting in shock fell significantly over the study interval (P \&lt; 0·026).
                  
                  
                  Conclusion
                  Problems with judgement are more common than those of skill. Death from traumatic haemorrhage is associated with identifiable, remediable failures in care. The implementation of a systematic trauma quality improvement system was associated with a fall in the mortality rate among patients presenting in shock.},

  abstract = {A common problem in computer vision -- particularly in medical applications -- is a lack of sufficiently diverse, large sets of training data. These datasets often suffer from severe class imbalance. As a result, networks often overfit and are unable to generalize to novel examples. Generative Adversarial Networks ({GANs}) offer a novel method of synthetic data augmentation. In this work, we evaluate the use of {GAN}- based data augmentation to artificially expand the {CheXpert} dataset of chest radiographs. We compare performance to traditional augmentation and find that {GAN}-based augmentation leads to higher downstream performance for underrepresented classes. Furthermore, we see that this result is pronounced in low data regimens. This suggests that {GAN}-based augmentation a promising area of research to improve network performance when data collection is prohibitively expensive.},

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},
